Description: A lightweight local vector index for approximate nearest neighbor
    (ANN) search using the vendored USearch library. Provides a simple interface
    for adding vectors, searching for nearest neighbors, and persisting indexes
    to disk. Metadata filtering is performed in R on the candidate set returned
    by the C++ layer.
